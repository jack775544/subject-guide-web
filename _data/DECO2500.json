Many students come into the course expecting to do coding or design work and become sorely disappointed. \u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eAssessment involves weekly practicals, a research paper, and a final exam. 40% of the grade are weekly pracs worth 4% each. These weekly pracs can be easy marks if you prepare beforehand. As with any group work, be sure to find good people to work with in the first week. \u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eThe second big assessment is the research document from a choice of 20 topics. Some involve real-world testing, and some are just literature reviews. Feel free to pick whatever you\u0027d like, but some topics are easier than others. \u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eThe final exam will quiz you on the textbook. Make sure to read it cover to cover, as you will be quizzed on specific case studies in the book. Past exam questions will be your friend when studying for the final exam. \u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003ePenelope Sanderson is a lecturer from the Psychology department. If you approach the course as more of a psychology course than an engineering course, then you will have better expectation and understanding of the activities. Not everyone will enjoy this course, but the course gives a solid foundation to understanding how usabilitiy testing makes for better software.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e",
