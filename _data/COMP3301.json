Matt and Tutors extremely helpful and very short response times. \u003cbr/\u003eThrough the course you will cover the different parts that make up an operating system kernel (especially a linux kernel), and assignments focus on concurrency and display (X11, but almost any display driver will be accepted). \u003cbr/\u003eNote that while the textbook is mandatory, it is extremely useful. You will cover the entirety of the textbook throughout the course. \u003cbr/\u003eThe exam is fairly easy to prepare for, but going in without doing previous year\u0027s exams will result in failure. \u003cbr/\u003eIf you enjoyed 2310, I would highly recommend this course. \u003cbr/\u003e",
